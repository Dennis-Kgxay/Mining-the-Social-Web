"From the 03.24.2020 edition of MSNBC‚Äôs All In With Chris Hayes:</p>"" "
"On MSNBC‚Äôs All In last night, host Chris Hayes laid into Trump‚Äôs dangerous lie-filled claims about the coronavorus outbreak. "
Hayes ripped into Trump for ladling out falsehoods in a Fox News virtual town hall earlier Tuesday. 
"‚ÄúEaster is two and half weeks away,‚Äù Hayes noted. ‚ÄúOther countries that have battled this epidemic have had lockdowns for 60 days. The place with the worst outbreak in the world, Wuhan, China, are still in lockdown. Maybe they‚Äôll be out in time for Easter?‚Äù "
The host of MSNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúAll In‚Äù blasted Trump‚Äôs aim to ease restrictions to stop the spread of the virus by Easter ‚Äï a move that would contradict advice from health experts and a slew of the president‚Äôs former advisers. 
Chris Hayes on Tuesday warned that President Donald Trump has become ‚Äúa genuine threat to public health‚Äù with falsehoods he spreads daily about the coronavirus pandemic.

" Sellers added: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs kind of incredible they are now trying to rewrite history to say we have plenty of resources when they‚Äôve systematically targeted them. They should be held responsible by the American people as it is outrageous.‚Äù</p>"" "
"‚ÄúThe administration has repeatedly and systematically corroded critical parts of the CDC,‚Äù Sellers said. ‚ÄúThis was just begging for an epidemic to hit us. It was a perfect storm of lack of preparation.‚Äù "
"Christopher Sellers, an expert in the environment and health at Stony Brook University and a lead author of the report, said the Trump administration‚Äôs actions slowed down the response to the virus and probably affected the preparedness of hospitals and various government agencies to the crisis. "
[‚Ä¶] 
"The CDC has still undergone an ‚Äúerosion of budget and staff under Trump‚Äù but without Congress‚Äôs defiance ‚Äúthousands more Americans would likely die over the next few months because of even more reduced capacity at the CDC‚Äù, according to the report, compiled by the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative (EDGI). "
"The administration disbanded the national security council‚Äôs directorate charged with global health and has sought to go further still, requesting budget cuts from the CDC of up to 20% for each of the past three years, only to be rebuffed by Congress. Trump‚Äôs effort to dismantle the Affordable Care Act would also have reduced the CDC‚Äôs funding by around 8% a year. "
"Over the past three years, the Trump administration has drastically reduced a team working in China to identify global health threats like Covid-19, which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year. The initiative‚Äôs 11 CDC staffers have been cut to three people, while 39 workers classed as ‚Äúlocal employees‚Äù have been reduced to 11 people. "
"""<p>The Trump administration badly undermined the effort to contain the coronavirus outbreak by getting rid of most staff tasked with identifying global health problems in China while repeatedly attempting to slash funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), according to a new report by an environmental watchdog. "
"Yesterday, in response to calls to end social distancing measures coming from the likes of Glenn Beck, Dan Patrick, and Donald Trump, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo was on-point to rebuff their costly advice: ‚ÄúMy mother is not expendable. And your mother is not expendable. And our brothers and sisters are not expendable.‚Äù</p>"" "
"‚ÄúMy mother is not expendable. And your mother is not expendable. And our brothers and sisters are not expendable. We‚Äôre not going to accept a premise that human life is disposable,‚Äù Cuomo said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to put a dollar figure on human life.‚Äù "
"Several states have issued stay-at-home orders, mandated business closures and suspended large public gatherings since the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus a pandemic. During a Tuesday press conference, Cuomo decried Trump and his conservative allies who, in recent days, have argued the financial costs of these protective measures are too great. "

Sam ‚Äì Okay. Can you go ahead and write me a prescription for that? 
"Dr. Trump ‚Äì Sounds like an essential worker to me. Your country‚Äôs economy needs you. Look, if you start to have symptoms, there‚Äôs some things you can do. Drink lots of scalding hot water.

Dr. Trump ‚Äì What do you do for a living?

"The first published work by an artificial intelligence was published in 2018, 1 the Road, marketed as a novel, contains sixty million words. "
"Though natural language processing tasks are closely intertwined, they are frequently subdivided into categories for convenience. A coarse division is given below. "
"The following is a list of some of the most commonly researched tasks in natural language processing. Some of these tasks have direct real-world applications, while others more commonly serve as subtasks that are used to aid in solving larger tasks. "
Systems based on machine-learning algorithms have many advantages over handproduced rules: 
"Many different classes of machine-learning algorithms have been applied to natural-language-processing tasks. These algorithms take as input a large set of ""features"" that are generated from the input data. Some of the earliest-used algorithms, such as decision trees, produced systems of hard if-then rules similar to the systems of handwritten rules that were then common. Increasingly, however, research has focused on statistical models, which make soft, probabilistic decisions based on attaching real-valued weights to each input feature. Such models have the advantage that they can express the relative certainty of many different possible answers rather than only one, producing more reliable results when such a model is included as a component of a larger system. "
"Since the so-called ""statistical revolution""[11][12] in the late 1980s and mid 1990s, much natural language processing research has relied heavily on machine learning. The machine-learning paradigm calls instead for using statistical inference to automatically learn such rules through the analysis of large corpora (the plural form of corpus, is a set of documents, possibly with human or computer annotations) of typical real-world examples. "
"In the early days, many language-processing systems were designed by hand-coding a set of rules:[9][10] such as by writing grammars or devising heuristic rules for stemming. "
"parsing,[7][8] and many others. Popular techniques include the use of word embeddings to capture semantic properties of words, and an increase in end-to-end learning of a higher-level task (e.g., question answering) instead of relying on a pipeline of separate intermediate tasks (e.g., part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing). In some areas, this shift has entailed substantial changes in how NLP systems are designed, such that deep neural network-based approaches may be viewed as a new paradigm distinct from statistical natural language processing. For instance, the term neural machine translation (NMT) emphasizes the fact that deep learning-based approaches to machine translation directly learn sequence-to-sequence transformations, obviating the need for intermediate steps such as word alignment and language modeling that were used in statistical machine translation (SMT). "
"In the 2010s, representation learning and deep neural network-style machine learning methods became widespread in natural language processing, due in part to a flurry of results showing that such techniques[4][5] can achieve state-of-the-art results in many natural language tasks, for example in language modeling,[6] "
"Recent research has increasingly focused on unsupervised and semi-supervised learning algorithms. Such algorithms are able to learn from data that has not been hand-annotated with the desired answers, or using a combination of annotated and non-annotated data. Generally, this task is much more difficult than supervised learning, and typically produces less accurate results for a given amount of input data. However, there is an enormous amount of non-annotated data available (including, among other things, the entire content of the World Wide Web), which can often make up for the inferior results if the algorithm used has a low enough time complexity to be practical. "
"Many of the notable early successes occurred in the field of machine translation, due especially to work at IBM Research, where successively more complicated statistical models were developed. These systems were able to take advantage of existing multilingual textual corpora that had been produced by the Parliament of Canada and the European Union as a result of laws calling for the translation of all governmental proceedings into all official languages of the corresponding systems of government. However, most other systems depended on corpora specifically developed for the tasks implemented by these systems, which was (and often continues to be) a major limitation in the success of these systems. As a result, a great deal of research has gone into methods of more effectively learning from limited amounts of data. "
"Up to the 1980s, most natural language processing systems were based on complex sets of hand-written rules. Starting in the late 1980s, however, there was a revolution in natural language processing with the introduction of machine learning algorithms for language processing. This was due to both the steady increase in computational power (see Moore's law) and the gradual lessening of the dominance of Chomskyan theories of linguistics (e.g. transformational grammar), whose theoretical underpinnings discouraged the sort of corpus linguistics that underlies the machine-learning approach to language processing.[3] Some of the earliest-used machine learning algorithms, such as decision trees, produced systems of hard if-then rules similar to existing hand-written rules. However, part-of-speech tagging introduced the use of hidden Markov models to natural language processing, and increasingly, research has focused on statistical models, which make soft, probabilistic decisions based on attaching real-valued weights to the features making up the input data. The cache language models upon which many speech recognition systems now rely are examples of such statistical models. Such models are generally more robust when given unfamiliar input, especially input that contains errors (as is very common for real-world data), and produce more reliable results when integrated into a larger system comprising multiple subtasks. "
"During the 1970s, many programmers began to write ""conceptual ontologies"", which structured real-world information into computer-understandable data. Examples are MARGIE (Schank, 1975), SAM (Cullingford, 1978), PAM (Wilensky, 1978), TaleSpin (Meehan, 1976), QUALM (Lehnert, 1977), Politics (Carbonell, 1979), and Plot Units (Lehnert 1981). During this time, many chatterbots were written including PARRY, Racter, and Jabberwacky. "
"Some notably successful natural language processing systems developed in the 1960s were SHRDLU, a natural language system working in restricted ""blocks worlds"" with restricted vocabularies, and ELIZA, a simulation of a Rogerian psychotherapist, written by Joseph Weizenbaum between 1964 and 1966. Using almost no information about human thought or emotion, ELIZA sometimes provided a startlingly human-like interaction. When the ""patient"" exceeded the very small knowledge base, ELIZA might provide a generic response, for example, responding to ""My head hurts"" with ""Why do you say your head hurts?"". "
"The Georgetown experiment in 1954 involved fully automatic translation of more than sixty Russian sentences into English. The authors claimed that within three or five years, machine translation would be a solved problem.[2] However, real progress was much slower, and after the ALPAC report in 1966, which found that ten-year-long research had failed to fulfill the expectations, funding for machine translation was dramatically reduced. Little further research in machine translation was conducted until the late 1980s, when the first statistical machine translation systems were developed. "
"In 1950, Alan Turing published an article titled ""Computing Machinery and Intelligence"" which proposed what is now called the Turing test as a criterion of intelligence[clarification needed]. "
"The history of natural language processing (NLP) generally started in the 1950s, although work can be found from earlier periods. "
"Challenges in natural language processing frequently involve speech recognition, natural language understanding, and natural language generation. "
"Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.
