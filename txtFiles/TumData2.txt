What‚Äôs scary is how much this has shown the ugliness and corruption that underlies our society. We all knew it but to show it in full force is frightening. Our politicians are selling us out and saying that profits matter over human lives. The sheer lack of respect and care for the people they are meant to represent is sick.

To quote the late Michelle McNamara though ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs chaos. Be kind.‚Äù If the government won‚Äôt care for us we care for each other. We are stronger together, stronger than just saying ‚Äústock up on toilet paper!‚Äù . We the people are stronger than fear. And we need to be smarter than fear too. Stay inside if you can, protect each other and be there for each other (though not physically). The world is chaos right now, but it always has been. Bring order to the chaos my friends. 

Love each other, and make sure you love yourself. Isolation hurts, and the fear of what‚Äôs to come is piercing. But stand strong. We are in this together, and what happens next doesn‚Äôt matter. What happens now is all we can worry about. The future has yet to happen, prepare for it but it is not written in stone. The world will keep turning, we will wake up tomorrow. Life will continue, it will be hard for a while but we will continue. 

Be smart, be wise and be good. That‚Äôs all we can do. I love you all, and I am here for those who need to talk. Those who are frightened and scared, because I know I am too. But know you‚Äôre not alone, even if you have to physically be alone for a while.</p>"

<p>London woman dies of suspected Covid-19 after being told she was ‚Äònot priority‚Äô</p>
"<p>I find that we all collectively know COVID-19 will pass and that we will be alright in the end but it‚Äôs the waiting for it that hurts. All viruses pass and get cured or the body builds immunities etc etc but that‚Äôs not what‚Äôs scary I feel.

What‚Äôs scary is how much this has shown the ugliness and corruption that underlies our society. We all knew it but to show it in full force is frightening. Our politicians are selling us out and saying that profits matter over human lives. The sheer lack of respect and care for the people they are meant to represent is sick.

To quote the late Michelle McNamara though ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs chaos. Be kind.‚Äù If the government won‚Äôt care for us we care for each other. We are stronger together, stronger than just saying ‚Äústock up on toilet paper!‚Äù . We the people are stronger than fear. And we need to be smarter than fear too. Stay inside if you can, protect each other and be there for each other (though not physically). The world is chaos right now, but it always has been. Bring order to the chaos my friends. 

Love each other, and make sure you love yourself. Isolation hurts, and the fear of what‚Äôs to come is piercing. But stand strong. We are in this together, and what happens next doesn‚Äôt matter. What happens now is all we can worry about. The future has yet to happen, prepare for it but it is not written in stone. The world will keep turning, we will wake up tomorrow. Life will continue, it will be hard for a while but we will continue. 

Be smart, be wise and be good. That‚Äôs all we can do. I love you all, and I am here for those who need to talk. Those who are frightened and scared, because I know I am too. But know you‚Äôre not alone, even if you have to physically be alone for a while.</p>"

Mais um dia de estudos em casa.

Acho que √© √≥bvio, mas o presidente atual do Brasil √© um imbecil, pra dizer o m√≠nimo. √â absurda a falta de profundidade nas coisas que ele fala, a falta de empatia com quem √© mais vulner√°vel. Isso n√£o √© novidade; antes das elei√ß√µes ele j√° apresentava esse mesmo comportamento e se algu√©m n√£o sabia, foi porque n√£o quis saber. N√£o √© quest√£o de ser de direita ou de esquerda, √© quest√£o de ter humanidade o suficiente pra ocupar um cargo no qual a premissa mais b√°sica √© servir o povo. √â triste imaginar quanta gente vai morrer por causa da irresponsabilidade desse sujeito.

Por falar em quanta gente vai morrer, isso me traz √† mente a classe empresarial desse pa√≠s. Um bando de homens brancos, ricos, absurdamente privilegiados, comparando a morte de ‚Äú5 mil ou 7 mil‚Äù pessoas com a economia. Com um sistema no qual o seu valor √© exclusivamente baseado no que voc√™ tem e que caga pra voc√™ se voc√™ √© pobre. √â claro que eles v√£o defender esse sistema, pois, afinal, foi esse sistema que os colocou nessa posi√ß√£o de superioridade em rela√ß√£o a imensa maioria das pessoas. A grande verdade √© que eles n√£o ligam se algu√©m vai morrer, eles s√≥ ligam se as empresas deles v√£o continuar dando lucro, mesmo que ‚Äú15 mil‚Äù morram. Ah, e eles n√£o se importam porque eles n√£o v√£o morrer, j√° que s√£o ricos e podem se enfiar num bunker por mais 50 anos sem ter medo do dinheiro acabar.

"<p>Hey! I am a housewife who doesn‚Äôt often leave the house when there isn‚Äôt a massive pandemic going on so here are my tips. 

1. Keep a flexible schedule Wake up at approximately the same time, have a mini routine in place. You can adjust it for what you need but it really helps me keep the days straight and move along without too much down time. 

 I even have my household chores on a schedule (I use the app Habitica to keep track and do a fun rp based game). 

2. Keep Active Gyms are closed and you need to social distance. But right now you can do a lot of home workouts for free. I like Yoga with Adriene for my Yoga. Just move around a bit. Jump rope, jog in place, lift water bottles instead of weights. It will make you feel better. Walk your dog

3. Give Yourself Something to Look Forward To Maybe for you it‚Äôs watching a TV show after you finish work, or taking a bath, or whatever you can do regularly that will brighten your day. I plan a weekly menu and look forward to dinner every night. 

4. Find or Do a Favorite Hobby Find something to occupy your time that engrosses you. I knit, crochet, color and play switch these days. Most hobbies even have the bonus that they will keep you occupied so you‚Äôre not just snacking out of boredom. I can even sometimes watch Netflix while doing these hobbies, but they keep my hands and brain occupied enough so I can focus on dialogue without being as distracting as the internet. 

5. Keep in Contact Text, facetime, call, message your friends and family. Ask them about their day or send them a funny meme but check in. You‚Äôll feel less isolated and alone if you still have some contact with others. If there are people or animals in your home that you can hold or touch, do that too.</p>"

Dr. Trump‚Äôs Office12:30pm Wednesday, March 25, 2020Attendance: Dr. Trump, Sam

(Sam stands in the middle of an empty room. Dr. Trump enters.)

Dr. Trump ‚Äì Are you Sam? Nice to meet you. (Reaches out his hand.) C‚Äômon. I‚Äôm a handshaker. 

Sam ‚Äì Should we be shaking hands?

Dr. Trump ‚Äì Trust me. I‚Äôm wearing a lab coat. 

Sam ‚Äì Okay.

(They shake hands. Dr. Trump pulls him in close.)

Dr. Trump ‚Äì How are you today? I‚Äôm great, by the way. Just great. The country‚Äôs great. The Dow is up. One of the biggest gains in the history of history. No need to tell me how you are doing. You‚Äôre fine. I say so.

(Sam pulls away from Trump.)

Sam ‚Äì Well, I think I may have been exposed to the Coronavirus. My neighbor just got back from Spring Break and had a Coronavirus party in his apartment last night. Then this morning he coughed on me in the hallway on his way to church.

Dr. Trump ‚Äì Hold your breath for ten seconds.

Sam ‚Äì Okay‚Ä¶? (Sam takes in a breath.)

Dr. Trump ‚Äì That‚Äôs good enough. You‚Äôre fine.

Sam ‚Äì You‚Äôre not going to give me a test?

Dr. Trump ‚Äì Tests are like, you know, they‚Äôre medical tests. Very unpleasant. 

Sam ‚Äì Do you not have any tests?

Dr. Trump ‚Äì I have millions of them, and they are perfect. All perfect. Just like the phone call. Perfect.

Sam ‚Äì Then maybe you should give me a test just to be sure.

Dr. Trump ‚Äì Are you rich or famous? Then, no. Look, if you do have it, it‚Äôs just the flu. You‚Äôll get it, feel bad for a few days, and then feel better. It will go away. Like a miracle. Or you‚Äôll die. But that‚Äôs mostly old people. What you really should do is go back to work. 

Sam ‚Äì But what if I do have it? I‚Äôll risk getting everyone else sick.

Dr. Trump ‚Äì What do you do for a living?

Sam ‚Äì I teach aqua aerobics in a swimming pool at a senior citizen retirement home. 

Dr. Trump ‚Äì Sounds like an essential worker to me. Your country‚Äôs economy needs you. Look, if you start to have symptoms, there‚Äôs some things you can do. Drink lots of scalding hot water. Put a hair dryer on high heat and blow it up your nose for ten minutes. Take some malaria drugs like chloroquine phosphate. You‚Äôll feel right as rain in no time. At least by Easter. 

Sam ‚Äì Okay. Can you go ahead and write me a prescription for that?

Dr. Trump ‚Äì I could, except I am not a doctor. 

Sam ‚Äì Then why are you telling people what to do about the virus?

Dr. Trump ‚Äì My uncle taught at MIT. He was a brilliant genius. Taught nuclear stuff, I think. Plus. doctors tell me I‚Äôm a natural at this sort of thing. 

Sam ‚Äì I think I‚Äôm just going to go home and isolate myself from others, especially you.

Dr. Trump ‚Äì I may not be a real doctor, but I still bill like one. See you in church! Or court!</p>"

"<p>Ja‚Äôhan Jones at HuffPost: 

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) dismissed calls Tuesday from President Donald Trump, Republican lawmakers and some conservative pundits for the United States to end its social distancing measures in an effort to spur the economy. 

Several states have issued stay-at-home orders, mandated business closures and suspended large public gatherings since the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus a pandemic. During a Tuesday press conference, Cuomo decried Trump and his conservative allies who, in recent days, have argued the financial costs of these protective measures are too great. 

‚ÄúMy mother is not expendable. And your mother is not expendable. And our brothers and sisters are not expendable. We‚Äôre not going to accept a premise that human life is disposable,‚Äù Cuomo said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to put a dollar figure on human life.‚Äù 

Yesterday, in response to calls to end social distancing measures coming from the likes of Glenn Beck, Dan Patrick, and Donald Trump, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo was on-point to rebuff their costly advice: ‚ÄúMy mother is not expendable.

"<p>The Trump administration badly undermined the effort to contain the coronavirus outbreak by getting rid of most staff tasked with identifying global health problems in China while repeatedly attempting to slash funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), according to a new report by an environmental watchdog.

Over the past three years, the Trump administration has drastically reduced a team working in China to identify global health threats like Covid-19, which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year. The initiative‚Äôs 11 CDC staffers have been cut to three people, while 39 workers classed as ‚Äúlocal employees‚Äù have been reduced to 11 people.

The administration disbanded the national security council‚Äôs directorate charged with global health and has sought to go further still, requesting budget cuts from the CDC of up to 20% for each of the past three years, only to be rebuffed by Congress. Trump‚Äôs effort to dismantle the Affordable Care Act would also have reduced the CDC‚Äôs funding by around 8% a year.

The CDC has still undergone an ‚Äúerosion of budget and staff under Trump‚Äù but without Congress‚Äôs defiance ‚Äúthousands more Americans would likely die over the next few months because of even more reduced capacity at the CDC‚Äù, according to the report, compiled by the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative (EDGI).

[‚Ä¶]

Christopher Sellers, an expert in the environment and health at Stony Brook University and a lead author of the report, said the Trump administration‚Äôs actions slowed down the response to the virus and probably affected the preparedness of hospitals and various government agencies to the crisis.

‚ÄúThe administration has repeatedly and systematically corroded critical parts of the CDC,‚Äù Sellers said. ‚ÄúThis was just begging for an epidemic to hit us. It was a perfect storm of lack of preparation.‚Äù

  Sellers added: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs kind of incredible they are now trying to rewrite history to say we have plenty of resources when they‚Äôve systematically targeted them. They should be held responsible by the American people as it is outrageous.‚Äù</p>"

Dr. Trump ‚Äì How are you today? I‚Äôm great, by the way. Just great. The country‚Äôs great. The Dow is up. One of the biggest gains in the history of history. No need to tell me how you are doing. You‚Äôre fine. I say so.

(Sam pulls away from Trump.)

Sam ‚Äì Well, I think I may have been exposed to the Coronavirus. My neighbor just got back from Spring Break and had a Coronavirus party in his apartment last night. Then this morning he coughed on me in the hallway on his way to church.

Dr. Trump ‚Äì Hold your breath for ten seconds.

Sam ‚Äì Okay‚Ä¶? (Sam takes in a breath.)

Dr. Trump ‚Äì That‚Äôs good enough. You‚Äôre fine.

Sam ‚Äì You‚Äôre not going to give me a test?

Dr. Trump ‚Äì Tests are like, you know, they‚Äôre medical tests. Very unpleasant. 

Sam ‚Äì Do you not have any tests?

Dr. Trump ‚Äì I have millions of them, and they are perfect. All perfect. Just like the phone call. Perfect.

Sam ‚Äì Then maybe you should give me a test just to be sure.

Dr. Trump ‚Äì Are you rich or famous? Then, no. Look, if you do have it, it‚Äôs just the flu. You‚Äôll get it, feel bad for a few days, and then feel better. It will go away. Like a miracle. Or you‚Äôll die. But that‚Äôs mostly old people. What you really should do is go back to work. 

Sam ‚Äì But what if I do have it? I‚Äôll risk getting everyone else sick.

Dr. Trump ‚Äì What do you do for a living?

Sam ‚Äì I teach aqua aerobics in a swimming pool at a senior citizen retirement home. 

Dr. Trump ‚Äì Sounds like an essential worker to me. Your country‚Äôs economy needs you. Look, if you start to have symptoms, there‚Äôs some things you can do. Drink lots of scalding hot water. Put a hair dryer on high heat and blow it up your nose for ten minutes. Take some malaria drugs like chloroquine phosphate. You‚Äôll feel right as rain in no time. At least by Easter. 

Sam ‚Äì Okay. Can you go ahead and write me a prescription for that?

Dr. Trump ‚Äì I could, except I am not a doctor. 

Sam ‚Äì Then why are you telling people what to do about the virus?

Dr. Trump ‚Äì My uncle taught at MIT. He was a brilliant genius. Taught nuclear stuff, I think. Plus. doctors tell me I‚Äôm a natural at this sort of thing. 

Sam ‚Äì I think I‚Äôm just going to go home and isolate myself from others, especially you.

Dr. Trump ‚Äì I may not be a real doctor, but I still bill like one. See you in church! Or court!</p>"

"<p>The Trump administration badly undermined the effort to contain the coronavirus outbreak by getting rid of most staff tasked with identifying global health problems in China while repeatedly attempting to slash funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), according to a new report by an environmental watchdog.

Over the past three years, the Trump administration has drastically reduced a team working in China to identify global health threats like Covid-19, which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year. The initiative‚Äôs 11 CDC staffers have been cut to three people, while 39 workers classed as ‚Äúlocal employees‚Äù have been reduced to 11 people.

The administration disbanded the national security council‚Äôs directorate charged with global health and has sought to go further still, requesting budget cuts from the CDC of up to 20% for each of the past three years, only to be rebuffed by Congress. Trump‚Äôs effort to dismantle the Affordable Care Act would also have reduced the CDC‚Äôs funding by around 8% a year.

The CDC has still undergone an ‚Äúerosion of budget and staff under Trump‚Äù but without Congress‚Äôs defiance ‚Äúthousands more Americans would likely die over the next few months because of even more reduced capacity at the CDC‚Äù, according to the report, compiled by the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative (EDGI).

[‚Ä¶]

Christopher Sellers, an expert in the environment and health at Stony Brook University and a lead author of the report, said the Trump administration‚Äôs actions slowed down the response to the virus and probably affected the preparedness of hospitals and various government agencies to the crisis.

‚ÄúThe administration has repeatedly and systematically corroded critical parts of the CDC,‚Äù Sellers said. ‚ÄúThis was just begging for an epidemic to hit us. It was a perfect storm of lack of preparation.‚Äù

The initiative‚Äôs 11 CDC staffers have been cut to three people, while 39 workers classed as ‚Äúlocal employees‚Äù have been reduced to 11 people.

The administration disbanded the national security council‚Äôs directorate charged with global health and has sought to go further still, requesting budget cuts from the CDC of up to 20% for each of the past three years, only to be rebuffed by Congress. Trump‚Äôs effort to dismantle the Affordable Care Act would also have reduced the CDC‚Äôs funding by around 8% a year.

The CDC has still undergone an ‚Äúerosion of budget and staff under Trump‚Äù but without Congress‚Äôs defiance ‚Äúthousands more Americans would likely die over the next few months because of even more reduced capacity at the CDC‚Äù, according to the report, compiled by the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative (EDGI).

[‚Ä¶]

Christopher Sellers, an expert in the environment and health at Stony Brook University and a lead author of the report, said the Trump administration‚Äôs actions slowed down the response to the virus and probably affected the preparedness of hospitals and various government agencies to the crisis.

‚ÄúThe administration has repeatedly and systematically corroded critical parts of the CDC,‚Äù Sellers said. ‚ÄúThis was just begging for an epidemic to hit us. It was a perfect storm of lack of preparation.‚Äù

  Sellers added: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs kind of incredible they are now trying to rewrite history to say we have plenty of resources when they‚Äôve systematically targeted them. They should be held responsible by the American people as it is outrageous.‚Äù</p>"
"<p>Lee Moran at HuffPost:

Chris Hayes on Tuesday warned that President Donald Trump has become ‚Äúa genuine threat to public health‚Äù with falsehoods he spreads daily about the coronavirus pandemic.

The host of MSNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúAll In‚Äù blasted Trump‚Äôs aim to ease restrictions to stop the spread of the virus by Easter ‚Äï a move that would contradict advice from health experts and a slew of the president‚Äôs former advisers.

‚ÄúEaster is two and half weeks away,‚Äù Hayes noted. ‚ÄúOther countries that have battled this epidemic have had lockdowns for 60 days. The place with the worst outbreak in the world, Wuhan, China, are still in lockdown. Maybe they‚Äôll be out in time for Easter?‚Äù

Hayes ripped into Trump for ladling out falsehoods in a Fox News virtual town hall earlier Tuesday.

On MSNBC‚Äôs All In last night, host Chris Hayes laid into Trump‚Äôs dangerous lie-filled claims about the coronavorus outbreak.

Dr. Trump‚Äôs Office12:30pm Wednesday, March 25, 2020Attendance: Dr. Trump, Sam

(Sam stands in the middle of an empty room. Dr. Trump enters.)

Dr. Trump ‚Äì Are you Sam? Nice to meet you. (Reaches out his hand.) C‚Äômon. I‚Äôm a handshaker. 

Sam ‚Äì Should we be shaking hands?

Dr. Trump ‚Äì Trust me. I‚Äôm wearing a lab coat. 

Sam ‚Äì Okay.

(They shake hands. Dr. Trump pulls him in close.)

Dr. Trump ‚Äì How are you today? I‚Äôm great, by the way. Just great. The country‚Äôs great. The Dow is up. One of the biggest gains in the history of history. No need to tell me how you are doing. You‚Äôre fine. I say so.

(Sam pulls away from Trump.)

Sam ‚Äì Well, I think I may have been exposed to the Coronavirus. My neighbor just got back from Spring Break and had a Coronavirus party in his apartment last night. Then this morning he coughed on me in the hallway on his way to church.

Dr. Trump ‚Äì Hold your breath for ten seconds.

Sam ‚Äì Okay‚Ä¶? (Sam takes in a breath.)

Dr. Trump ‚Äì That‚Äôs good enough. You‚Äôre fine.

Sam ‚Äì You‚Äôre not going to give me a test?

Dr. Trump ‚Äì Tests are like, you know, they‚Äôre medical tests. Very unpleasant. 

Sam ‚Äì Do you not have any tests?

Dr. Trump ‚Äì I have millions of them, and they are perfect. All perfect. Just like the phone call. Perfect.

Sam ‚Äì Then maybe you should give me a test just to be sure.

Dr. Trump ‚Äì Are you rich or famous? Then, no. Look, if you do have it, it‚Äôs just the flu. You‚Äôll get it, feel bad for a few days, and then feel better. It will go away. Like a miracle. Or you‚Äôll die. But that‚Äôs mostly old people. What you really should do is go back to work. 

Sam ‚Äì But what if I do have it? I‚Äôll risk getting everyone else sick.

Dr. Trump ‚Äì What do you do for a living?

Sam ‚Äì I teach aqua aerobics in a swimming pool at a senior citizen retirement home. 

Dr. Trump ‚Äì Sounds like an essential worker to me. Your country‚Äôs economy needs you. Look, if you start to have symptoms, there‚Äôs some things you can do. Drink lots of scalding hot water. Put a hair dryer on high heat and blow it up your nose for ten minutes. Take some malaria drugs like chloroquine phosphate. You‚Äôll feel right as rain in no time. At least by Easter. 

Sam ‚Äì Okay. Can you go ahead and write me a prescription for that?

Dr. Trump ‚Äì I could, except I am not a doctor. 

Sam ‚Äì Then why are you telling people what to do about the virus?

Dr. Trump ‚Äì My uncle taught at MIT. He was a brilliant genius. Taught nuclear stuff, I think. Plus. doctors tell me I‚Äôm a natural at this sort of thing. 

Sam ‚Äì I think I‚Äôm just going to go home and isolate myself from others, especially you.

Dr. Trump ‚Äì I may not be a real doctor, but I still bill like one. See you in church! Or court!</p>"

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) dismissed calls Tuesday from President Donald Trump, Republican lawmakers and some conservative pundits for the United States to end its social distancing measures in an effort to spur the economy. 

Several states have issued stay-at-home orders, mandated business closures and suspended large public gatherings since the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus a pandemic. During a Tuesday press conference, Cuomo decried Trump and his conservative allies who, in recent days, have argued the financial costs of these protective measures are too great. 

‚ÄúMy mother is not expendable. And your mother is not expendable. And our brothers and sisters are not expendable. We‚Äôre not going to accept a premise that human life is disposable,‚Äù Cuomo said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to put a dollar figure on human life.‚Äù 

Yesterday, in response to calls to end social distancing measures coming from the likes of Glenn Beck, Dan Patrick, and Donald Trump, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo was on-point to rebuff their costly advice: ‚ÄúMy mother is not expendable.
